Of course. Looking at the homepage (image_c3b0de.png), it's clear that it's the most visually dynamic page on the site, combining many of the different blocks we've been discussing. It has a strong foundation, but we can definitely apply our new design system to make it feel more cohesive, premium, and better aligned with the professional B2B aesthetic we've established on the other pages.

Here is a block-by-block visual enhancement plan for the homepage.

Homepage Visual Refresh Plan (Styling Only)
Goal: To unify the homepage's various sections under our new, theme-driven design system, creating a more professional, trustworthy, and visually engaging "front door" for your B2B customers.

1. Hero Section ("Reliable supplier...")
   Current State: Strong image, clear headline. The text can be a bit hard to read against the busy background.

The B2B Goal: Maximum clarity and a powerful first impression of authority.

Styling Action:

Typography: Apply our theme's font-serif to the main <h1>. This immediately elevates the headline.

Overlay: It looks like this section is already using one of our image treatments (likely dark-50 or dark-30), which is great for text contrast. We will keep this.

CTA Hierarchy: Establish a clearer visual order for the buttons.

"Explore the catalog" should be the primary action. Let's style it as a solid button using bg-primary.

"Contact us" is the secondary action. Style it as an outlined "ghost" button using border bg-transparent hover:bg-white/10. This guides the user's eye to the most important next step.

2. "Certified Quality You Can Trust" Section
   Current State: A clean two-column layout. It feels a bit disconnected from the rest of the page.

The B2B Goal: To present this crucial trust-building information as a foundational, credible statement.

Styling Action:

Use a Surface Color: Wrap this entire two-column section in a container div and apply the bg-surface-1 class from our theme. This will visually group the text and the IFS Broker logo into a single, cohesive block and lift it off the main background.

Typography: Ensure the heading within this block ("Certified Quality You Can Trust") is font-semibold to give it appropriate weight.

3. Product Category Links ("Millet & groats," etc.)
   Current State: Four images with text overlays. The images are very dark and lack interactivity cues.

The B2B Goal: These are key navigation elements. They should be clear, inviting, and feel like tangible links to your product catalog.

Styling Action:

Remove Dark Overlays: Replace the heavy dark overlays on the images with our much subtler overlay-dark-30 from the theme. This will allow the product imagery to be more visible.

Apply Card Styling: Wrap each of the four link blocks in a container with border rounded-lg. This defines them as distinct, clickable elements.

Add Hover Interaction: Add a hover:shadow-md effect and perhaps a subtle zoom on the background image (group-hover:scale-105) to provide clear visual feedback that these are interactive cards.

4. "The LAR Group Advantage" Section
   Current State: Three cards containing text and icons. The styling is very basic.

The B2B Goal: These are your core value propositions. They need to look as professional and reliable as the promises they make.

Styling Action:

Apply Full Card Styling: For each of the three cards, apply our standard theme styling: bg-card border rounded-lg p-6.

Refine Inner Layout: Left-align the text within each card for better readability.

Enhance Icons: Make the icons more prominent. Wrap each one in a small, rounded container with a bg-muted background to give it more presence.

5. Final CTA ("Partner with a Leader in Quality")
   Current State: A simple centered text block with a button.

The B2B Goal: This is the final "ask" of the page. It should be a strong, unmissable call to action.

Styling Action:

Use a Surface Color: Just like the "Certified Quality" section, wrap this entire CTA block in a container with bg-surface-1 to give it a distinct visual space on the page.

Typography: Apply font-serif to the headline ("Partner with a Leader...") to give it a conclusive, authoritative tone.

Button: Ensure the "Explore our catalog" button is using the primary bg-primary style.

Summary of Impact
By applying these theme-driven styling changes, the homepage will be transformed:

Cohesive: All sections will share the same visual language of cards, surfaces, and typography.

Professional: The page will have a clear visual rhythm and hierarchy, guiding the user's eye intentionally.

Trustworthy: The enhanced credibility of the "Certified Quality" and "Advantage" sections will better support your B2B sales goals.
