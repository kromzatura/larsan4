# Multilingual Documentation Index

> **Purpose:** Establish a single source of truth for multilingual planning artifacts, ranked by execution priority, and provide actionable next steps starting from the highest-priority document.

---

## Priority Order

| Code | Document | Why it leads |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ML-02** | [Multilingual Foundation Upgrade Plan](./multi-language-foundation-plan.md)<br/>↳ Action plan: [ML-02 execution checklist](./action-plan/ML-02-foundation.md) | Defines the active scope for unlocking locale-aware routing, schemas, queries, and workflows. |

> _Legacy planning artifacts now live under [`docs/legacy/`](./legacy/) and can be referenced on demand._

## Action List for ML-02 — Foundation Upgrade

1. **Align on cross-cutting objectives** → Review the four objectives with engineering and content leads to ensure shared outcomes ([Section: Immediate Cross-Cutting Objectives](./multi-language-foundation-plan.md#immediate-cross-cutting-objectives)).
2. **Sequence initiatives** → Confirm the order and staffing for Initiatives 1–6, capturing any blockers or dependencies ([Initiative overview](./multi-language-foundation-plan.md#initiative-1--locale-centric-routing-infrastructure)).
3. **Spin up execution checklist** → Break the highest priority initiative into actionable tasks using the [ML-02 execution checklist](./action-plan/ML-02-foundation.md).
4. **Publish progress updates** → Record learnings and decision logs back into the foundation plan so the roadmap stays current ([Next Steps](./multi-language-foundation-plan.md#next-steps)).

## Next Steps

- Continue to iterate on **ML-02** deliverables; this index will expand as new active documents are created.
- Archive superseded artifacts in [`docs/legacy/`](./legacy/) after their insights are folded into the active plan.
