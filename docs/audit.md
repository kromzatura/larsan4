Architecture

Strong:
Separate specification docs referenced by product: avoids duplication, enables reuse.
Block-based page composition with a centralized blocks renderer.
Centralized SEO via generatePageMetadata across routes.
Weak:
Blocks passes searchParams to all blocks, not just those that need it (broader typing, slightly leaky API).
PRODUCTS_BY_CATEGORY_QUERY order injected via string replace; brittle against query refactors.
Routes & UX

Strong:
/products made dynamic to support ?category= filters; canonical excludes query (SEO safe).
/products/category/[slug] with generateStaticParams(), sorting, pagination, and breadcrumbs.
/products/[slug] has rich details and structured spec tables.
Weak:
Table rows not fully clickable; only image/title are links.
No aria annotations for sorting (where used), and minimal table semantics beyond <th>.
Blocks/UI

Strong:
“All Products 16” matches needed columns, SSR pagination, image/title linking, category badges link to filter.
Category chips block highlights active and now gracefully handles invalid ?category.
Empty state when category has no products; hides pagination appropriately.
Weak:
Minor spacing/typography polish pending (e.g., consistent cell padding, vertical rhythm).
Add-to-inquiry button prominence can be increased for scannability.
Hover feedback great on rows; could add subtle focus-visible styles for keyboard users.
Data & Queries

Strong:
List queries project only fields needed for table (sku, purity, attributes, features, image, categories).
Dedicated count queries to avoid over-fetching.
Weak:
Category-order and product-order are encoded in separate queries; ordering injection via replace is error-prone.
Some fetch helpers return broad shapes; consider narrower types per use case for payload efficiency.
SEO & Metadata

Strong:
Canonicals are correct for all primary pages; filters are not canonicalized (good).
Sitemap includes pages, products, and product categories.
Robots config references the sitemap and respects noindex via env + per-doc.
Weak:
Optional enhancement: “page > 1” on /products could set robots: noindex (prevents thin duplicates).
Ensure NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL is set in all environments (sitemap correctness).
Performance

Strong:
Next/Image with targeted sizes in listings and detail pages.
Server-side fetching avoids request waterfalls; pagination caps payloads.
Weak:
dynamic = "force-dynamic" on /products disables caching; acceptable for live filters, but consider adding short ISR if your data doesn’t change frequently.
Add-to-inquiry client component is fine, but when many items render, hydrate cost can add up. Keeping the button isolated is good; avoid turning the whole row into a client component.
Accessibility

Strong:
Links and buttons are keyboard accessible; badges-as-links provide clear navigation.
Product images have meaningful alt text fallback to title.
Weak:
Table semantics: add scope="col" on <th> for assistive tech.
Ensure visible focus states on interactive chips and badges (hover styles exist; focus-visible should be explicit).
DX & Types

Strong:
Sanity TypeGen in use; types in components are strict.
GROQ composed and grouped logically.
Weak:
Blocks uses ...(block as any) when passing props; could narrow per-component prop types via a typed component map for extra safety.
Risks / Cons

Plugin ecosystem drift (Studio): Keep Sanity/Studio plugin versions consistent; orderable lists and code-input rely on Sanity v3-compatible versions. Verify lockfile alignment post-reset.
Order injection hack: String replacement for order() is fragile; test on refactors.
Recommendations

Routing/SEO
Keep /products dynamic; optionally add short revalidate if acceptable and content isn’t changing minute-to-minute.
Optionally set noindex for /products?page>1 (only if you care about duplicate inventory pages).
UI/UX
Make the full row clickable to the product (add an absolutely-positioned link overlay that excludes the action cell to avoid nested anchors).
Increase Add-to-Inquiry button width (e.g., className="px-6 w-full max-w-44") and ensure consistent centering.
Tighten table spacing: standardize px-6 py-4, check alignment of bullet lists (key features) and badges.
Accessibility
Add scope="col" to table headers; ensure focus-visible styles for chips/badges (e.g., outline-none focus-visible:ring variants).
Code & Queries
Replace string order(...) injection with a small query switch (3 const queries) or accept the replace but encapsulate in a helper function with tests.
Refine Blocks to pass searchParams only to blocks that consume them; remove any spread by mapping component props per block \_type.
Content Safety
Invalid category slugs currently show empty state; that’s good. Optionally show “Unknown category” copy if you want clearer feedback.
Quick Wins (1–2 hours)

Full-row click with safe overlay and button preserved.
Wider action button; consistent table padding/typography.
th scope="col" and focus-visible ring on chips/badges.
Swap order injection to a tiny helper or a 3-query switch for category sorting.
