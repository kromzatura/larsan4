# Static Generation Fix - All Locales

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Impact:** 🚀 High Performance Improvement

---

## Problem Identified

The `generateStaticParams()` functions in product and blog post pages were only generating static pages for the **fallback locale** (`en`). This meant:

- ❌ Dutch (`nl`) pages were **not pre-rendered** at build time
- ❌ Dutch pages used ISR/SSR (slower, more server load)
- ❌ Missing the main benefit of Static Site Generation
- ❌ Performance penalty for non-English users

## Solution Implemented

Updated `generateStaticParams()` to loop through **all supported locales** and generate static params for each.

### Files Modified

1. **`frontend/app/[lang]/(main)/products/[slug]/page.tsx`**
2. **`frontend/app/[lang]/(main)/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`**

### Code Pattern

**Before:**
```typescript
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const slugs = await fetchSanityProductSlugs({ lang: FALLBACK_LOCALE });
  return slugs
    .filter((s) => s.slug?.current)
    .map((s) => ({ slug: s.slug!.current! }));
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { SUPPORTED_LOCALES, FALLBACK_LOCALE } from "@/lib/i18n/config";

export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const params: { lang: string; slug: string }[] = [];

  for (const locale of SUPPORTED_LOCALES) {
    const slugs = await fetchSanityProductSlugs({ lang: locale });
    for (const s of slugs) {
      if (s.slug?.current) {
        params.push({ slug: s.slug.current, lang: locale });
      }
    }
  }

  return params;
}
```

## Impact & Benefits

### Performance Improvements

✅ **All product pages** now pre-rendered for both `en` and `nl`  
✅ **All blog posts** now pre-rendered for both `en` and `nl`  
✅ **Faster page loads** - HTML served from CDN instead of on-demand rendering  
✅ **Reduced server load** - No runtime rendering needed  
✅ **Better SEO** - Faster Time to First Byte (TTFB)  

### Build Time

Expected build time will increase slightly as it pre-renders more pages, but this is a worthwhile trade-off for:
- Much faster runtime performance
- Better user experience
- Lower server costs

### Example Build Output

**Before:**
```
Route                             Size     First Load JS
┌ ○ /[lang]/products/[slug]      2 kB          85.3 kB
└   └ /en/products/pepper        (generated during build)
```

**After:**
```
Route                             Size     First Load JS
┌ ● /[lang]/products/[slug]      2 kB          85.3 kB
├   ├ /en/products/pepper        (generated)
├   ├ /en/products/turmeric      (generated)
├   ├ /nl/products/peper         (generated)
└   └ /nl/products/kurkuma        (generated)
```

Legend:
- ○ (Server) server-side renders at runtime
- ● (SSG) automatically generated as static HTML + JSON

## Testing

✅ **TypeCheck:** PASS  
✅ **Tests:** 30/30 PASS  
✅ **Build:** Ready for verification

## Next Steps

1. **Run a production build** to verify all pages generate:
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm run build
   ```

2. **Check build output** - Look for the list of generated pages

3. **Verify Dutch pages** exist in `.next/server/app/nl/`

4. **Test navigation** between locales to ensure all links work

## Additional Notes

### Category Pages

Product and blog **category** pages remain dynamic (`force-dynamic`) because they have:
- Pagination (different page numbers)
- Sorting options (newest, A-Z, Z-A)
- Query parameters that change frequently

This is intentional and correct. Category pages should use ISR/SSR.

### Page Routes

The dynamic `[lang]/[slug]/page.tsx` was **already correctly implemented** to generate for all locales using:

```typescript
return SUPPORTED_LOCALES.flatMap((lang) =>
  pageSlugs.map((slug) => ({ lang, slug }))
);
```

No changes needed there.

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Import `SUPPORTED_LOCALES` added to both files
- [x] Loop through all locales in `generateStaticParams()`
- [x] Return array with both `lang` and `slug` properties
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes
- [x] All tests pass
- [ ] Production build verification
- [ ] Deployment to staging
- [ ] Performance testing

**Result:** 🎉 The multilingual foundation is now **fully optimized** for static generation across all supported locales!
