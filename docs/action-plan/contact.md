Contact Page Visual Refresh Plan (Styling Only)
Goal: To use our Sanity-driven theme to transform the contact page into a polished, professional hub that instills confidence and is easy to use for a B2B partner.

1. Headline: Establish a Professional Tone
   Current State: The headline "Speak with Our Friendly Team" is font-sans.

The B2B Goal: The main heading should feel authoritative and established.

Styling Action:

Typography: Apply our theme's font-serif class to the <h1>. This simple change immediately elevates the page's tone to be more formal and premium.

Alignment: Left-align the headline and the introductory paragraph. This improves readability for a professional audience.

2. The Form (Right Column): Create a Clear Focal Point
   Current State: The form is a simple set of inputs on the main page background.

The B2B Goal: The form is the primary interactive tool on this page. It should be presented as a distinct, self-contained module.

Styling Action:

Apply Card Styling: Wrap the entire form (labels, inputs, and the submit button) in a container div and apply our standard card styling from the theme: bg-card border rounded-lg p-8. This visually "lifts" the form off the page, making it the clear focus and signaling that it's an interactive element.

Input Fields: Ensure the input fields are using our theme's variables for a consistent look. They should have a clear and accessible focus state (focus:ring-2 focus:ring-ring).

3. Contact Details (Left Column): Add Structure and Presence
   Current State: The contact details are a simple list with small icons.

The B2B Goal: This isn't just a list; it's a directory of how to officially engage with your company. Each method should feel distinct and important.

Styling Action:

Enhance the Icons: Give each icon (Email Us, Call Us, Visit Us) more visual weight. Wrap each icon in a container div styled as a circle or rounded square with a subtle background color, like bg-muted or bg-primary/10. Make the icon itself slightly larger.

Improve Typography:

Make the titles ("Email Us," "Call Us," "Visit Us") bolder with font-semibold.

The actual contact details (sales@largseeds.nl, the phone number) should be clearly presented. Make the email address a mailto: link with a distinct hover state.

4. The Submit Button: A Clear Conclusion
   Current State: A standard button.

The B2B Goal: The final action should be clear, compelling, and unambiguous.

Styling Action:

Primary Action: Ensure the "Submit" button is using our primary button style (bg-primary text-primary-foreground).

Full Width: Make the button w-full within its form container. This makes it a large, confident, and easy-to-click target, clearly signaling the end of the form-filling process.

Summary of Impact
These visual-only changes, powered by our theme, will significantly enhance the B2B feel of the contact page:

It will look more organized and professional, with clear visual separation between the contact information and the form.

The form itself will feel like a secure and reliable tool for submitting an inquiry.

The entire page will feel more credible, reinforcing the image of LAR Group as an established and trustworthy partner to do business with.
